Think of it this way: There are two kinds of failure. The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit.

If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. **Repeated failure** will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.

- The future belongs to those who learn more **skills** and combine them in creative ways.
- No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you.

People around you, constantly under the pull of their emotions, change their ideas by the day or by the hour, depending on their mood. You must never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.

We are all in search of feeling more connected to realityâ€”to other people, the times we live in, the natural world, our character, and our own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly tends to separate us from these realities in various ways. We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality.

In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this connection is through creative activity.

Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small reality we create. In doing this work, we are in fact creating ourselves.
